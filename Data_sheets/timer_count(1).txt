Timer Configuration Calculation:
====================================

Timer Clock Frequency:

The timer clock is derived from the system clock (APB1 or APB2 bus clock, depending on the timer). 

Let's assume the system clock (APB1) is running at 84 MHz.

Prescaler (PSC):
----------------
The prescaler divides the system clock to produce the timer clock. 
The prescaler value you set is PSC, which means the timer clock will 
be the system clock divided by (PSC + 1).

For simplicity, let’s choose a prescaler value of 8399. 
This will divide the system clock by 8400:

	      System Clock	84 MHz
Timer Clock = --------------  =  ---------  = 10 KHz
	      Prescaler + 1	8399 + 1


Period (ARR - Auto-Reload Register):
------------------------------------
The period value determines how many timer ticks occur 
before the timer overflows and triggers an interrupt. 
To achieve a 5-second delay, you need the timer to count 50,000 times (since the timer clock is 10 kHz).

Period = Timer Clock × Delay Time = 10kHz × 5s = 50,000

Since the timer counts from 0 to ARR, the value to be set in the period register is 49,999.
